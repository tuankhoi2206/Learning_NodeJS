*Practical Node.js* Conclusion
==============================

Lo and behold, this is the end of the book. There was a study that showed that the majority of programmers read zero books per year ([source](http://blog.codinghorror.com/programmers-dont-read-books-but-you-should/)). So, pat yourself on the back, because you’re on the road to awesomeness when it comes to building Node.js web apps. &#x263A;

Regarding the material covered in *Practical Node.js*, we explored real-world aspects of the Node.js stack. To do this, many things were essential, and by now you should have an awareness of how pieces fit together. For some technologies such as Pug and REST API, our coverage was quite extensive. However, most of the packages are very specific and tailored to our apps’ goals, so those topics were given a brief introduction, with references for further learning. Here’s a list of topics we covered:

-   Node.js and npm setup and development tools
-   Web apps with Express.js
-   TDD with Mocha
-   Pug and Handlebars
-   MongoDB and Mongoskin
-   Mongoose MongoDB ORM
-   Session, token authentication, and OAuth with Everyauth
-   REST APIs with Express and Hapi
-   WebSockets with ws, Socket.IO, and DerbyJS
-   Best practices for getting apps production ready
-   Deployment to Heroku and AWS
-   Structuring and publishing npm modules
